* Although no direct code was used, a good tutorial to get familiar with Tkinter, which I followed was the follwing: https://github.com/KeithGalli/GUI. Many thanks to the author, Keith Galli

The app is not well designed, and could be characterized as rather rigid. However it was ment as a self tutoring project
